In this ethical issue, I decided to focus on three systems and two ethical quandaries. These three systems are US Citizens, Federal Government, and Snowden's Mental Health. The two ethical quandaries are Ethical Concerns with Employer and Complicated Decision-Making.
I think Ethical Concerns with Employer affects US Citizens and Snowden's Mental Health because Snowden and many US Citizens work for the Federal Government and therefore that decision will affect their mental processes regarding their source of employment. Complicated Decision-Making is involved in the Federal Government and Snowden's Mental Health for separate reasons. In the Government's case, the complicated decision making is in how to handle the public's acquisition of information and then how to handle the releaser of that information, Snowden himself. Snowden's mental health was affected by complicated decision making.
